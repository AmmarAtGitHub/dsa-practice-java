# dsa-practice-java
Data Structures &amp; ALgorithms in Java - a collection of DSA implementations as part of my daily coding practice plan. Iâ€™m pushing solutions gradually as I practice und implement them in Java.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered  

This section lists the topics I've worked on so far. It's updated as I learn and implement each one.

- **Arrays**: Binary Search
- **Arrays**: Rotated Binary Search
- **Arrays**: Bubble Sort algorithm
- **Arrays**: Selection Sort algorithm
- **Arrays**: Insertion Sort algorithm

## How to Use  
- Each folder contains Java files for a specific topic.
